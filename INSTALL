Installing Honeysnap
--------------------

To get the dependencies, install easy_install http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall, then

sudo easy_install pcapy
sudo easy_install Impacket
sudo easy_install 4Suite
sudo easy_install pefile


For pyram, install from

svn+ssh://svn.honeynet.org/honeynet/pyram *

cd into the pyram directecory and run:
	python setup.py build
	sudo python setup.py install

You will also need ethereal installed, specifically the tethereal command line tool. This can be installed from

http://www.ethereal.com/

but on most UNIX-like systems it should be in your default packaging system.

The honeysnap script should be installed in some place like /usr/local/bin
(the exact location depends on your OS) which is probably already in your path.

Try to execute 'honeysnap':

	$ honeysnap

You should see:

	Usage:
	honeysnap.py <config file>

	Please see the accompanying documentation for instructions on
	configuration.

If not, run this to see where it got installed:

	find /usr -name honeysnap -print

(That command may take a while, but should print the full path of the script.)
