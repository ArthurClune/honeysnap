INSTALLYING HONEYSNAP
=====================

This document explains step by step how to install
Honeysnap, including all dependencies.  Suggestions
for this document, or Honeysnap in general should be
sent to <honeysnap@honeynet.org>.  This document is
broken down into the following parts.

1: Dependencies
2: Installation on a Linux/Unix/OS X Workstation
3: Installation on Windows
4: Installation on a Honeywall
5: Running Honeysnap


1. DEPENDENCIES
================

General Dependencies
 Python 2.4 or greater      http://www.python.org
 libpcap                    http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpcap/
 pypcap 1.1 or greater      http://code.google.com/p/pypcap/

Pure python modules:
 irclib 0.4.6 or greater    http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/
 dpkt                       http://code.google.com/p/dpkt/
 magic                      http://www.demonseed.net/~jp/code/magic.py

This latter set should be installed automatically and are listed
here for completeness.
      
2: INSTALLATION ON UNIX
========================

First, you will need to install python 2.4 or 2.5 and its header file.  Most
distributions most likely already have this installed.  Then you will
need libpcap.  For most UNIX-like systems, it should be in your package 
management system (apt-get, yum, DarwinPorts etc.).  You will need libcap 
and also libpcap-devel if that is listed separately.  For example, on
Debian/Ubuntu with python2.4:

  $ sudo apt-get install python24-dev
  $ sudo apt-get install libpcap0.8 libpcap0.8-dev

You should then be able to install Honeysnap and all its remaining
dependencies (provided you have a network connection).
E.g. for version 1.0.6:

  $ tar xvzf honeysnap-1.0.6
  $ cd honeysnap-1.0.6
  $ sudo python setup.py install

If you already have easy_install installed, you can simplify the
installation process further by simply executing the following.

  $ sudo easy_install honeysnap-1.0.6.tar.gz 

This is exactly the same as untar'ing the distribution and
running 'sudo python setup.py install'

Please note that this will install the honeysnap script into your
PATH, usually in /usr/bin. If this isn't what you want, specify
--script-dir. e.g

$ sudo easy_install --script-dir /usr/local/bin honeysnap-1.0.6.tar.gz

3: INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS
==========================

Download  and install the following, in order.

  * Python 2.4 (from http://www.python.org/download). You can install
  from the Windows MSI installer linked from that page.

  * winpcap from
  http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm  
	
  * pypcap from http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/pypcap
  You need to download and run the 'Windows Python 2.4 Installer'

To make Python easily available on the command line, right click
on "My Computer" and select Properties. Then go to Advanced and
choose Environment Variables. Add to the end of the PATH variable 

 ;C:\Python24;C:\Python24\Scripts

(assuming you installed Python to the default location). If you 
don't already have setuptools installed, you'll need to download 
ez_setup.py from

  http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py

and run it. This will install easy_setup. Finally run

  easy_install honeysnap-1.0.6.zip
                                                    
This should download and install honeysnap and all its
dependencies.
                 
4: INSTALLATION ON A HONEYWALL
==============================
                 
You cannot install in the same way as for a workstation on
a production honeywall, as it has no gcc compiler and
python 2.3 not 2.4. Follow these steps instead.

i) Install gcc

Edit legacy-base and legacy-updates repo files to enable the repos and
disable GPG key checking

Edit /etc/yum.repos.d/legacy-base.repo to read:

[legacy-base]
name=Fedora Legacy 3 - $basearch - Base
baseurl=http://download.fedoralegacy.org/fedora/3/os/$basearch
exclude=perl-GD snort wireshark
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
gpgkey=http://www.fedoralegacy.org/FEDORA-LEGACY-GPG-KEY

Edit /etc/yum.repos.d/legacy-updates.repo to read:

[legacy-updates]
name=Fedora Legacy 3 - $basearch - Updates
baseurl=http://download.fedoralegacy.org/fedora/3/updates/$basearch
exclude=perl-GD snort wireshark
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
gpgkey=http://www.fedoralegacy.org/FEDORA-LEGACY-GPG-KEY

ii) Install gcc

$ yum install gcc

iii) Install python 2.4

Create "/etc/yum.repos.d/python24.repo":

[python24]
name=Fedora Core $releasever - $basearch - Python 2.4
baseurl=http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.4/rpms/fedora-3/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.4/rpms/KRUD-GPG-KEY

$ yum install python2.4 python2.4-devel

iv) Install pypcap

$ wget http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/pypcap/pypcap-1.1.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf pypcap-1.1.tar.gz
$ cd pypcap-1.1
$ python2.4 setup.py config
$ python2.4 setup.py build
$ python2.4 setup.py install

v) Install Honeysnap

$ wget http://www.honeynet.org/tools/honeysnap/honeysnap-1.0.6.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf honeysnap-1.0.6.tar.gz
$ cd honeysnap-1.0.6
$ python2.4 setup.py install

vi) Test!

$ honeysnap --version


5: Running honeysnap
====================
Try to execute 'honeysnap':

  $ honeysnap

You should see:
                               
usage: honeysnap [options]

options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  [.... more options snipped....]

  Please see the accompanying documentation for instructions on
  configuration.
