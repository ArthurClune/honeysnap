Installing Honeysnap
--------------------
Python 2.4 or greater is strongly recommended.

To get the dependencies, install easy_install http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall, then

sudo easy_install pcapy
sudo easy_install Impacket
sudo easy_install 4Suite
sudo easy_install pefile


For pyram, install from

svn+ssh://svn.honeynet.org/honeynet/pyram *

cd into the pyram directecory and run:
	python setup.py build
	sudo python setup.py install

To make IRC functionality work you will need to install:
irclib 0.4.6 or greater  			http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/
pypcap 1.1 or greater  				http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/pypcap/
dpkt		 						http://monkey.org/~dugsong/dpkt/

The honeysnap script should be installed in some place like /usr/local/bin
(the exact location depends on your OS) which is probably already in your path.

Try to execute 'honeysnap':

	$ honeysnap

You should see:

	Usage:
	honeysnap.py <config file>

	Please see the accompanying documentation for instructions on
	configuration.

If not, run this to see where it got installed:

	find /usr -name honeysnap -print

(That command may take a while, but should print the full path of the script.)
