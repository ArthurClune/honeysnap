Installing Honeysnap
--------------------

First install these:
        http://oss.coresecurity.com/repo/pcapy-0.10.4.tar.gz
        http://oss.coresecurity.com/repo/Impacket-0.9.5.2.tar.gz
        http://dkbza.org/pefile/pefile-1.0.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.4suite.org/pub/4Suite/4Suite-XML-1.0b3.tar.gz
        svn+ssh://svn.honeynet.org/honeynet/pyram *

* Need to get a public location for this one.

In each of those, and this directory, run:
	python setup.py build
	sudo python setup.py install

The honeysnap script should be installed in some place like /usr/local/bin
(the exact location depends on your OS) which is probably already in your path.

Try to execute 'honeysnap':

	$ honeysnap

You should see:

	Usage:
	honeysnap.py <config file>

	Please see the accompanying documentation for instructions on
	configuration.

If not, run this to see where it got installed:

	find /usr -name honeysnap -print

(That command may take a while, but should print the full path of the script.)
