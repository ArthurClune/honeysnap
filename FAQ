Some common questions/problems.

1). Honeysnap is showing all counts as zero even though I know 
there are packets it should be counting!

A) Check that your honeypot IP addresses are correct. If they
are wrong, honeysnap will be looking for packets to hosts that
may well not even be in the pcap file, hence the zero counts

2) When Honeysnap processes separate pcap files it reports on
each one separately. How do I get it to just report on all the
files as one?

A) There is no functionality in Honeysnap itself to do this
currently, however it is easy to do. First use another program
to merge the pcap files into one and then run honeysnap on 
the result.

One program that does this is pcapmerge, which is part of 
tcpreplay, available from

http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/tcpreplay/

Install this, and then use

pcapmerge -o outfile pcap1 pcap2

to merge the files pcap1 and pcap2 into one file 'outfile'.
Then run honeysnap over 'outfile'.
