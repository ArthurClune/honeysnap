Honeysnap TODO list

$Id$

* Fix TCPFlow to deal correctly with nasty things like duplicate ACKS...
 these are corupting the data

* We need to change the flow of program execution so each packet only 
gets decoded once.  

* honeysnap could possibly drop the data for two different flows with 
the same srcip:srcport-dstip:dstport

* http pipelined requests are broken
