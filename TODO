Honeysnap TODO list

* Fix TCPFlow to deal correctly with nasty things like duplicate ACKS...
 these are corupting the data

* We need to change the flow of program execution so each packet only gets decoded once.  Right now, dep$

* The output format of the flows isn't that useful. Maybe write a general
output class/fn that prints out the top N talkers, ordered by traffic
count. N would be defined in the config file
             
* honeysnap could possibly drop the data for two different flows with the same srcip:srcport-dstip:dstpo$

* we strip the http header and store that as filename.hdr -- this is mostly done
BIG PROBLEM: http pipelined requests are broken!!!!!
